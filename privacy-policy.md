# RealClient Mirror Privacy Policy

## Overview
RealClient Mirror is a Chrome extension that helps web developers test their websites on different device sizes. This privacy policy explains how we handle user data.

## Data Collection
RealClient Mirror does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or browsing data. All settings and configurations are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API and are never sent to external servers.

## Local Storage
The extension stores only the following information locally on your device:
- Custom device profiles you create
- URL patterns you configure
- UI preferences

This data never leaves your browser and is only used to provide the extension's functionality.

## Permissions
RealClient Mirror requests certain permissions (activeTab, storage, scripting, tabs) solely to provide its core functionality of simulating different device sizes on websites. These permissions are not used to collect or transmit any user data.

## Third-Party Services
RealClient Mirror does not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services.

## Changes to This Policy
If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update it here.
